## pset5 (Language: C)

### Lessons Learned
This problem set took me the longest to do. I have struggled with C's lower level memory management so I initially skipped this problem set and came back to the end. This increased the time commitment greatly because i had to relearn the C memory I have forgotten. In the end it probably was for the best studying these concepts I was struggling with twice. I have no real tips on this one just keep working on it.

#### My Time Commitment 9/10
