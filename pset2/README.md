## pset2 (Language: C)
### Tip 1: Pay attention to the lectures
This pset seemed easier than the pset one as long as you stick to the easier
problems. All the code you need to build the two ciphers is presented in the lectures
or in the problems themselves.
### Tip 2: Focus on C data types
My biggest problem this week was not understanding how to change a variable from
form to another in C. For example changing a sting to an int or understanding the
difference between a char* and a char. This lead to me getting segmentation fault
run time errors I did not expect from my experience with other languages.
