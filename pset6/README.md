### Tip 1: Porting
While porting your programs from C to Python it is sometimes easier to change the
nature of your code. For example in my credit.py and credit.c I saved the credit
card number as a string and manipulated that string to get the checksum. However
there are more tools in python that allow you to easily manipulate the string,
so my method of calculating the checksum are quite different.

### Tip 2: Break it into Three
Break sentiment into three different problems, Smile, Tweets, and Sentiment.
Write code for each. The definition analyzer is simpler for Smile than the
video's lead on. It must be changed for Tweets and Sentiments
