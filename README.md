# cs50x
This is a repository for keeping my HarvardX: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science files as i work through them.
I sometimes find I like to go back and change code after I have submitted it which I can do here. My programing experience is mainly in JavaScript and Python, so I have little experience with lower-level languages such as C.

### Primary Languages Used
C and Python

### WARNING...
If you are taking the class it is against academic rules to copy (or even read other peoples code from what I gather)
and pass it off as your own, so don't do it. However I will add tips and thought I had while working through the psets
in this read me. I have included some code snippets but nothing specific. If you are not taking the class and would
like to see my solutions feel free to check them out. All the code uses a cs50 library designed to make C simpler for
beginners but might cause some confusion for people more familiar with C.

### General Tips
If you are struggling try watching the next weeks lecture. They often discuss
"what was learned" in the last pset that could help you solve your problem. If you
are working on the *more comfortable* lesson try watching the *less comfortable*
walkthrough, which often gives more information.


### pset0 (Language: Scratch)
See my code here: [Catch the Butterfly](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/149761466/)

#### For other psets see the README in folder.
