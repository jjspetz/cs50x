### Lessons Learned
This problem set teaches the value of good comments. I had not had much experience figuring out code so complex written by anyone other than myself. Slowly work through the code and the other various resources and you can figure out what the given code does and what little you need to add. However it was slow going for myself. After doing this problem I will work harder on making my code more readable and giving longer comments explaining what my own functions and files do.
