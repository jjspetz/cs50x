## pset7

### Primary Language
Python

### Other Languages / Frameworks
HTML/CSS, SQLite, Flask, Jinja2

### Tip 1: Read and Watch everything
The problem sets are getting more complicated so make sure you watch all the
cs50 videos for the pset and read over all the documentation a couple times.
This will save you time in the long run, but if you enjoy figuring out everything
for yourself, running into dead ends, and taking twice is long to complete the
project, go for it. There is some value in figuring out how to solve your own
programing solutions
